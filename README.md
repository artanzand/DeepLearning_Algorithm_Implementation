# Deep Learning - Algorithm Implementation

My intention in this repo is to build deep Neural Networks in three gradual steps. I will be walking through the steps and math in ipynb files.

1. One-node Neural Network
> To simulate a Logistic Regression through a neural net with just one node.

2. Neural Network with one hidden layer 
> To build a complete 2-class classification neural network with a hidden layer. No regularization implemented. tanh() will be the activaiton function for the hidden layer and sigmoid() will be the activation function for the output layer.

3. Deep Neural Network
> To implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use the building blocks in the previous part to build a neural network of any architecture. 
> No regularization will be implemented at this stage.
